More details on the necessity of a correctly specified model for the underlying mortality process and its impact on further research are discussed in <cit.>. Numerous publications review the ongoing discussion on the existence of a mortality plateau <cit.>, and the levelling-off of adult human death rates at the oldest ages is supported by the findings in <cit.> while others cast some doubt on this observation <cit.>. If there is a mortality plateau then the distribution of deaths at the oldest-old ages must be gamma-Gompertz and human lifespan can increase further without any maximum <cit.>. Further studies discuss the existence of a limit to human lifespan with more focus on the extreme value distribution aspect of the deaths at the oldest-old ages for various populations and different lifetime distributions <cit.>. These models can be helpful in determining the plausibility of longevity leaders as well.\n\nWe contribute to this discussion by proposing a stochastic model to describe the evolution of the age of the world's oldest person. Based on our estimates the model provides a good fit to the titleholder data since 1955, collected by the Gerontology Research Group <cit.>.\nWith the model results, it is possible to predict the age of the oldest person in the world in the future.\nWhen should we expect to see the next Jeanne Calment, the supercentenarian with the longest human lifespan ever documented?\nWill her record ever be surpassed?\nOur results provide a prediction for the age distribution of the record holder in the coming decades to answer these questions.\n\n\n\n\n§ RESULTS\n\n\nOur model describes the evolution of the age of the oldest living person under the following assumptions.\nWe assume that the births of individuals follow a Poisson process with time-dependent intensity <cit.>.\nThe lifespans of individuals in the population are independent and their distribution may depend on the date of birth.\nThen the age of the record holder in the population evolves in time as a Markov process with explicit transition probabilities.\nAs the first main result of this paper, we explicitly compute the distribution of the age of the record holder for any given birth rate parameter and lifespan distribution.\nThe detailed mathematical description and the properties of the general model are described in Section <ref>.\n\nWe apply our general result to the case which approximates the human birth rate over the world and the human lifespan.\nWe specify the intensity function of the Poisson process of births to have an exponential growth in time.\nThe underlying force of mortality is chosen so that it follows an extension of the Gompertz mortality model <cit.>\nand the lifespan distribution of individuals is given by the gamma–Gompertz () distribution with time-dependent parameters.\nThis distribution adequately captures the slowing down of senescence mortality at the oldest old ages.\nGiven the growth parameters of the birth rate, we fit the model parameters to the statistics of the oldest person titleholder data using maximum likelihood method.\nThe optimal parameters of the model fit well to the data.\nIt shows in particular that the age of the oldest person alive increases over time, and it will most likely increase further in the future.\nWe compute the expected value and a confidence interval for the age of the world's oldest person using the fitted model parameters for each year between 1955 and 2019 shown by the green curves on Figure <ref>.\nThe detailed discussion of the model specification, likelihood calculations as well as the parameter fitting are given in Section <ref>.\nSection <ref> contains calculations related to the gamma–Gompertz–Makeham generalization of the gamma–Gompertz distribution.\n\n\n\n\nOur results enable us to predict the age distribution of the world's oldest person at future time points.\nWe compute the probability density of the age of the world's oldest person in different years not only in the past but also in the future.\nThese densities are shown in Figure <ref>.\nWhen comparing the age distribution of the oldest person in the world in different years to the age of Jeanne Calment at her death, we find that on Jan 1st 2060 we can expect that the age of the world's oldest person will exceed her age with probability around 0.5.\nThis also means that with high probability her age record will already be broken by that time.\n\n\n\nIn Figure <ref> two extreme outliers with unexpectedly long lifetimes can be observed. Jeanne Calment died at the age of 122.45 years in 1997, and Sarah Knauss died at the age 119.27 in 2000.\nIn our model, the probability of observing an age greater than or equal to their actual age at the time of their death is 0.000286 for Calment and 0.0116 for Knauss.\nSee details in Subsection <ref>.\n\nThe fact that Calment and Knauss are outliers among the oldest old in the world became even more evident when we performed a backtesting of our model. We estimated the parameters based on the data on the world's oldest person between 1955 and 1988 where the ending date is the time when Calment became the world's oldest person. The model-estimated mean and confidence interval of the world's oldest person using the full data and the partial dataset (before Calment) are shown in Figure <ref> by green and red, respectively.\nThe estimate using the data until 1988 is less reliable after 2000 which is shown by the fact that the observed data is out of the confidence interval in the majority of the time after 2000.\nWhen we compare the two confidence intervals, we can conclude that, based on the data before 1988, Calment and Knauss already had extremely high ages at their deaths.\nAdding the remaining data set, the estimated mean age of the world's oldest person becomes lower.\nHence we can conclude that now we can consider the ages of the two outliers between 1988 and 2000 at their death to be more extreme than based on the information available in 1988.\n\nThe other important observable is the reign length of a record holder.\nThe numerical value of the expected reign length with our estimated model parameters is 1.195 in 1955 and it is 1.188 in 2019.\nThe empirical value of the reign length is 1.008 which is not much less than the model-based estimate.\n\nOur approach to studying the age of the oldest old is completely novel because it takes into account jointly the age and the time of birth of individuals.\nAlthough the age and the reign length of the world's oldest person depend in a complex non-linear way on the total lifespan and the time of birth of supercentenarians, we compute explicitly the probability distribution of the age of the oldest person.\nHence, the performance of our predictions cannot be directly compared to previous results in the literature because in the usual approach, the oldest person in each cohort is considered separately, and it is not relevant whether this person was ever the oldest in the population, see e.g. the extreme value method in <cit.>.\nOur model contributes to the mathematical understanding of the evolution of the oldest individual, which is the extra benefit compared to a prediction using the trend in the data, e.g. in linear regression.\nIn this way, we not only observe but also prove mathematically that the dynamics of the birth process and that of the lifespan distribution which we consider in this paper necessarily imply the increase of the expected age of the world's oldest person.\n\n\n\n§ MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR THE AGE OF THE OLDEST PERSON\n\n\n\nIn this section, we provide the mathematical definition of a general model for the age of the world's oldest person, where the births of individuals follow a Poisson process and their lifespans are independent.\nUnder the assumptions of the general model, the age of the record holder in the population evolves in time as a Markov process with explicit transition probabilities.\nIn Subsections <ref>–<ref>, we describe the exact distribution of the age of the record holder in this generality\nfor any given birth rate parameter and lifespan distribution using the two-dimensional representation of the age process of the oldest person.\nIn the time-homogeneous case with constant birth rate and identical lifespan distributions the reign length distribution of a record holder is computed in Subsections <ref>–<ref>.\nWe explain the role of the entry age parameter in Subsection <ref>.\n\n\n\n §.§ Model description and two-dimensional representation\n\n\n\nThe model is formally defined as follows.\nLet λ(t) be the birth rate parameter which depends on time and let F_t and f_t be a family of cumulative distribution functions and density functions corresponding to non-negative random variables which are also time-dependent.\nWe assume that individuals are born according to a Poisson point process at rate λ(t) and that the lifespan of an individual born at time t is given by F_t so that lifespans are independent for different individuals.\n\nLet Y_t denote the age of the oldest person in the population at time t.\nThe process (Y_t:t∈) is Markovian.\nThe Markov property holds because at any time t the history of the process (Y_s:s≤ t) provides information about the lifetime of individuals born before the current record holder\nwhile any transition of (Y_s:s≥ t) depends only on the lifetime of the current record holder and of those born after them.\n\nThe evolution of the Markov process Y_t is the following.\nIt has a deterministic linear growth with slope 1 due to the ageing of the current record holder.\nThis happens until the death of the record holder.\nAdditionally, given that Y_t-=lim_s↑ tY_s=y for some t with y>0,\nthe process has a downward jump at time t at rate f_t(y)/(1-F_t(y)) which is the hazard rate of the distribution F_t at y.\nThis corresponds to the possibility that the record holder dies at time t which happens at rate f_t(y)/(1-F_t(y)).\nThe conditional distribution of the jump is given by\n\n    (Y_t<x | Y_t-=y,Y_t<y)\n    =exp(-∫_x^yλ(t-u)(1-F_t-u(u)) ụ)\n\nfor all x>0.\nThe jump distribution in (<ref>) has an absolutely continuous part supported on [0,y] with density\n\n    j_y,t(x)=exp(-∫_x^yλ(t-u)(1-F_t-u(u)) ụ)\n    λ(t-x)(1-F_t-x(x))\n\nand a point mass at 0 with probability\n\n    a_y,t=exp(-∫_0^yλ(t-u)(1-F_t-u(u)) ụ).\n\nAs we shall see in the relevant parameter regime the probability a_y,t of the point mass at 0 is negligible.\nThe transition formula in (<ref>) can be proven using the description below.\n\nWe introduce a two-dimensional representation of the process Y_t as follows.\nLet Λ={(t_i,x_i):i∈ I} be a marked Poisson process in ×_+\nwhere {t_i:i∈ I} forms a Poisson point process on  with intensity λ(t)\nand x_i≥0 is sampled independently for each i∈ I according to the distribution F_t_i.\nThe point (t_i,x_i) represents an individual born at time t_i with lifespan x_i for all i∈ I, that is, the individual i is alive in the time interval [t_i,t_i+x_i) and their age at time t is t-t_i if t∈[t_i,t_i+x_i).\nHence the marked Poisson process Λ contains all relevant information about the age statistics of the population at any time.\nIn particular the age of the oldest person Y_t can be expressed in terms of Λ as\n\n    Y_t=max{(t-t_i)𝕀_{t∈[t_i,t_i+x_i)}:i∈ I}.\n\nwhere the indicator 𝕀_{t∈[t_i,t_i+x_i)} is 1 exactly if the ith person is alive at time t.\n\nThe transition distribution formula (<ref>) can be seen using the two-dimensional representation as follows.\nGiven that the current record holder dies at time t at age y the event {Y_t<x} means that nobody with age between x and y can be alive at time t.\nThis event can be equivalently characterized in terms of the Poisson process of birth at rate λ(·) thinned by the probability that the person is still alive at time t.\nIndeed the event {Y_t<x} can be expressed as a Poisson process of intensity at time t-u given by λ(t-u)(1-F_t-u(u)) for u∈[x,y] not having any point in the time interval [t-y,t-x].\nThis probability appears exactly on the right-hand side of (<ref>).\nIn other words, for any u∈[x,y] people are born at time t-u at rate λ(t-u).\nOn the other hand, the probability for a person born at time t-u to be alive at time t (that is, at age u) is 1-F_t-u(u).\nSee Figure <ref> for illustration.\n\n\n\n\n\n §.§ Exact distribution of the oldest person's age process\n\n\n\nWe assume that all birth events are already sampled on (-∞,t] together with the corresponding lifespans.\nThen the distribution of Y_t can be computed explicitly for all t∈ using the two-dimensional representation.\nFor all t∈ the density\n\n    h_t(x)=exp(-∫_x^∞λ(t-u)(1-F_t-u(u)) ụ)\n    λ(t-x)(1-F_t-x(x))\n\nfor all x>0 and the point mass at 0\n\n    m_t=exp(-∫_0^∞λ(t-u)(1-F_t-u(u)) ụ)\n\ncharacterize the distribution of Y_t which can be seen as follows.\nWe mention that the point mass at 0 is negligible in the application.\n\nSimilarly to the proof of the transition formula in (<ref>) the event {Y_t<x} for any x>0 is the same as the event that nobody with age at least x is alive at time t.\nWe express this event in terms of the Poisson process of birth at rate λ(·) thinned by the probability that the person is still alive at time t.\nThe event {Y_t<x} means that a Poisson process of intensity at time t-u given by λ(t-u)(1-F_t-u(u)) for u≥ x does not have any point in (-∞,t-x] yielding\n\n    (Y_t<x)=exp(-∫_x^∞λ(t-u)(1-F_t-u(u)) ụ).\n\nIn other words for any u≥ x individuals are born at time t-u at rate λ(t-u).\nA person born at time t-u is alive at time t at age u with probability 1-F_t-u(u).\n(<ref>)–(<ref>) follow by differentiation in (<ref>) and by taking the x→0 limit.\nSee Figure <ref> for illustration.\n\n\n\n\n\n §.§ Homogeneous model\n\n\n\nThe exact computation of the reign length distribution (see Subsection <ref>) can only be performed in a special case of our general model described in Subsection <ref>.\nWe introduce this special case as the homogeneous model where individuals are born at the times of a Poisson process of constant rate λ=λ(t)>0 for all t.\nThe lifespan of individuals are independent and identically distributed with a fixed density f=f_t and cumulative distribution function F=F_t for all t which does not depend on time.\n\nIn the homogeneous model the jump distribution given in (<ref>)–(<ref>) simplifies to\n\n    j_y(x)   =j_y,t(x)=exp(-λ∫_x^y(1-F(u)) ụ)λ(1-F(x)),\n    \n    a_y   =a_y,t=exp(-λ∫_0^y(1-F(u)) ụ).\n\nThe distribution of Y_t does not depend on time in this case hence it is a stationary distribution as well.\nThe formulas for the density of Y_t and point mass at 0 reduce in the homogeneous case to\n\n    h(x)   =exp(-λ∫_x^∞(1-F(u)) ụ)λ(1-F(x)),\n    \n    m   =exp(-λ∫_0^∞(1-F(u)) ụ)\n\nwhere the integral ∫_0^∞(1-F(u)) ụ is equal to the expected lifespan.\n\nThe equilibrium condition for the homogeneous density h can be written as\n\n    h'(x)+h(x)f(x)/1-F(x)-∫_x^∞ h(y)f(y)/1-F(y)j_y(x) ỵ=0.\n\nAfter differentiation and using the fact that\n\n    /x̣j_y(x)=j_y(x)(λ(1-F(x))-f(x)/1-F(x))\n\none can derive from (<ref>) the second order differential equation\n\n    h”(x)+(2f(x)/1-F(x)-λ(1-F(x)))h'(x)\n    +(2f(x)^2/(1-F(x))^2+f'(x)/1-F(x))h(x)=0.\n\nThe point mass m at 0 satisfies\n\n    mλ=∫_0^∞ h(y)f(y)/1-F(y)j_y(0) ỵ.\n\n\n\n\n §.§ The peaks process\n\n\n\nIn the homogeneous model the sequence of peaks in Y_t forms a discrete time Markov chain.\nBy peak we mean a local maximum of Y_t with value being equal to the lifespan of the last record holder.\nEach time the oldest person dies the process Y_t has a peak with a downward jump following it.\nLet Z_n denote the age of record holders at which they die which are the values of the peaks of the process Y_t.\nThe sequence Z_n forms a discrete time Markov chain.\nThe Markov property follows by the fact that ages at death of previous record holders only give information on people born before the current record holder but transitions depend on the lifespan of the current record holder and that of people born after them.\n\nThe stationary density of Z_n is given by\n\n    z(x)=f(x)exp(-λ∫_x^∞(1-F(u)) ụ)/∫_0^∞ f(y)exp(-λ∫_y^∞(1-F(u)) ụ)ỵ.\n\nThe formula can be seen as follows.\nTo have a record holder who dies at age x there has to be a person who has lifespan x which gives the factor f(x) in the numerator on the right-hand side of (<ref>).\nThe exponential factor is by the two-dimensional representation equal to the probability that no people born before the record holder who just died can be alive at the time the record holder dies.\nThe denominator on the right-hand side of (<ref>) makes z(x) a probability density function.\n\nThe density of Z_n can also be characterized by the following description.\nIt satisfies the integral equation\n\n    z(x)=∫_0^∞ z(w)∫_0^min(x,y)j_w(y)f(x)/1-F(y) ỵ ẉ+∫_0^∞ z(w)a_wf(x) ẉ\n\nwhich comes from the possible transitions of the peak process as follows.\nIf the previous record holder had a total lifetime w∈[0,∞) then at the death the process Y_t jumps down to some value y at rate j_w(y) or to 0 with probability a_w.\nThe density of the age at which a person dies who becomes a record holder at age y is f(x)/(1-F(y)).\nFrom the integral equation in (<ref>) one can derive the second order differential equation for the function g(x)=z(s)/f(x) given by\n\n    g”(x)-λ(1-F(x))g'(x)+λ f(x)g(x)=0\n\nwhich is satisfied by g(x)=cexp(-λ∫_x^∞(1-F(u)) ụ) in accordance with (<ref>).\n\n\n\n §.§ Reign length distribution\n\n\n\nIn the homogeneous model, let W_n denote the reign length of the nth record holder, that is, the time length for which this person is the oldest person of the population.\nThe density of the random reign length is given by\n\n    r(w)=∫_0^∞ h(y)f(y+w) ỵ+m∫_0^wf(z)λ e^-λ(w-z)f(z) ẓ/∫_0^∞ h(y)(1-F(y)) ỵ+m.\n\nThe density formula in (<ref>) can be derived based on the stationary density of the peaks process given by (<ref>) as follows.\n\nIt holds for the density of the reign length that\n\n    r(w)=∫_0^∞ z(x)(∫_0^xj_x(y)f(y+w)/1-F(y) ỵ\n    +a_x∫_0^wf(z)λ e^-λ(w-z) ẓ)x̣\n\nbased on the decomposition with respect to the previous value of the peaks process Z_n.\nThe integral ∫_0^wf(z)λ e^-λ(w-z) ẓ is the density of the convolution of the density f with an independent exponential distribution of parameter λ.\nOn the right-hand side of (<ref>), one can use the definitions of the density z given by (<ref>) and the homogeneous jump distribution j_x and a_x given by (<ref>).\nThen in the numerator after the exchange of the order of integrations in the first term and by using the formula for the stationary distribution given by (<ref>) one gets the numerator of (<ref>).\nIn the denominator one can use the equality\n\n    ∫_0^∞ f(y)exp(-λ∫_y^∞(1-F(u)) ụ)ỵ\n    =∫_0^∞ h(y)(1-F(y)) ỵ+m.\n\nwhich follows by integration by parts.\n\nNote also that the density is not equal to the remaining reign length of Y_t under the stationary distribution because it would involve the integral ∫_0^∞ h(y)f(y+w)/(1-F(y)) ỵ in place of the first term in the numerator on the right-hand side of (<ref>).\n\n\n\n §.§ Entry age parameter\n\n\n\nNext we introduce another parameter which we call the entry age and we denote it by E.\nAs opposed to our original model we consider individuals as being born at age E at a modified birth rate and with a modified lifespan distribution.\nAs a result we obtain a model to the age of the world's oldest person all values of the entry age parameter E≥0 and we can fit the model parameters with different values of the entry age.\n\nFor any value E≥0 of the entry age we denote by λ_E(t) the rate at which people reach the age E at time t, that is,\n\n    λ_E(t)=λ(t-E)(1-F_t-E(E))\n\nbecause the new birth process of rate λ_E(t) is obtained by an inhomogeneous thinning of the original Poisson process of the birth events.\nThe lifespan distribution of those born at time t with age E becomes the remaining lifetime distribution at age E.\nThe modified cumulative distribution function and density are given by\n\n    F_t^E(x)=F_t-E(x+E)-F_t-E(E)/1-F_t-E(E),    \n    f_t^E(x)=f_t-E(x+E)/1-F_t-E(E).\n\n\n\n\n§ MODEL SPECIFICATION AND PARAMETER FITTING\n\n\n\nIn Subsection <ref> we specify the general model introduced and discussed in Section <ref>, that is,\nwe assume that the birth rate parameter increases exponentially in time and that the lifespan distribution is given by the gamma–Gompertz–Makeham distribution with time-dependent parameters.\nWe provide the details of the computation of the likelihood as a function of the model parameters in Subsection <ref>.\nWe show the way to maximize the likelihood and how the optimal parameters can be found using the Nelder–Mead method in Subsection <ref>.\nWith these values of the parameters, the age of the world's oldest person and the reign length of the record holder can be computed as described in Subsection <ref>.\n\n\n\n §.§ Model specification: birth rate parameter and lifespan distribution\n\n\n\nFor the rest of the paper we specifiy our general model described in Section <ref>\nto the following choice of the birth rate parameter and of the lifespan distribution.\nWe choose the value of the entry age to be E=0,30,60 and we fit the model parameters for all three values of E separately.\n\nFirst we specify the intensity function of the Poisson process of births with an exponential growth in time.\nFor any of the three values of the entry age E we assume that the birth rate at age E is given by\n\n    λ_E(t)=C_Ee^κ_Et\n\nwhere the numerical values of the parameters C_E and κ_E are obtained\nby linear regression of the logarithmic data of newborns, people at age 30 and 60 published by the United Nations since 1950.\nWe extrapolate the linear regression backwards in time and we use the numerical values shown in Table <ref>.\n\nWe assume that the underlying force of mortality is chosen so that the lifespan distribution of individuals follows the gamma–Gompertz () distribution with cumulative distribution function and density\n\n    F^_a,b,γ(x)   =1-(1+aγ/b(e^bx-1))^-1/γ,\n    \n    f^_a,b,γ(x)   =ae^bx(1+aγ/b(e^bx-1))^-1-1/γ\n\nfor x≥0 where a,b,γ are positive parameters.\nWe mention that the gamma–Gompertz–Makeham () distribution differs from the  distribution by the presence of a non-negative extrinsic mortality parameter c which appears as an additive term in the force of mortality.\nSee (<ref>) for the definition of the  distribution.\nIn our model, we exclude the extrinsic mortality for the following two reasons.\nSince the extrinsic mortality becomes irrelevant at high ages and we aim to model the front-end of the death distribution at the oldest-old ages,\nwe do not expect to obtain a reliable estimate on the extrinsic mortality using the data about the world's oldest person.\nOn the other hand, as explained later in Subsection <ref>, the likelihood maximization provides unrealistic lifespan distributions even for the  model if one tries to optimize in all the parameters at the same time.\nIn order for the algorithm to result in a distribution close to the actual human lifespan distribution, the number of model parameters had to be decreased.\n\nFor our model we suppose that in the  lifespan distribution, parameters b=b_E, the rate of aging and γ=γ_E, the magnitude of heterogeneity\nare constants over time and that they only depend on the value of the entry age parameter E.\nThe parameter a, the initial level of mortality at the entry age for individuals born at time t, depends on time given by the exponentially decreasing function\n\n    a_E(t)=K_Ee^-α_E(t-2000)\n\nwhere the exponent α_E and the constant K_E only depends on the entry age E.\nThe reason for subtracting 2000 in (<ref>) is only technical, the numerical values of the parameters do not become tiny with this definition.\n\nIn the model with entry age E, we assume that the birth rate λ_E(t) is given by (<ref>) and we fit the gamma–Gompetz distribution with parameters b_E,γ_E and a_E(t) given by (<ref>) for the modified distribution function F_t^E(x) and density f_t^E(x) in (<ref>).\nThis means that we search for the best fitting values of the parameters α_E,K_E,b_E,γ_E which results in an approximation of the remaining lifetime distribution at the age E.\n\n\n\n §.§ Likelihood calculations\n\n\n\nThe aim of the maximum likelihood method is to give an estimate to the parameters α_E, K_E, b_E and γ_E for E=0,30,60 by finding those values for which the likelihood of the full sample is the largest.\nThe sample is obtained from the the historical data on the world's oldest person available in <cit.>.\nWe transform this information into a list of triples of the form (t_i,y_i,z_i) for i=1,…,n\nwhere t_i is the ith time in the sample when the oldest person dies at age y_i and the new record holder has age z_i at time t_i.\nThen the data has to satisfy the consistency relation t_i-z_i=t_i+1-y_i+1 since the two sides express the date of birth of the same person.\n\nIn the model with entry age E, the likelihood of the ith data point (t_i,y_i,z_i) given the previous data point is equal to\n\n

probabilities of the model with entry age E given by\n\n    j^E_y,t(x)=exp(-∫_x^yλ_E(t-u+E)(1-F_t-u+E^E(u-E)) ụ)λ_E(t-x+E)(1-F_t-x+E^E(x-E))\n\nas a generalization of (<ref>).\nThe explanation of the left-hand side of (<ref>) is that the person died at time t_i at age y_i had age E at time t_i-y_i+E.\nThe previous data point ensures that this person has already reached age z_i-1 hence we condition their lifetime distribution on this fact.\nThe transition probabilities in (<ref>) are obtained similarly to (<ref>) with the difference that a person at age u with u∈[x,y] at time t had age E at time t-u+E.\n\nNote that when computing the likelihood of the full data by multiplying the right-hand side of (<ref>) for different values of i the consistency relation of the data implies that the factor 1-F_t_i-z_i+E(z_i-E) of the ith term cancels with the factor 1-F_t_i+1-y_i+1+E(z_i-E) coming from the (i+1)st term.\nHence the log-likelihood of the full sample is given by\n\n    l(α,K,b,γ)\n       =∑_i=1^n(log f_t_i-y_i+E^E(y_i-E)\n    -∫_z_i^y_iλ_E(t_i-u+E)(1-F_t_i-u+E^E(u-E)) ụ+logλ_E(t_i-z_i+E))\n    +log(1-F_t_n-z_n-E^E(z_n+E))\n       =∑_i=1^n(log f^_Ke^-α(t_i-y_i+E-2000),b,γ(y_i-E)\n

parameters α,K,b,γ on the entry age.\nNote that the last two terms do not depend on the parameters α,K,b,γ hence we can omit these terms in the maximization of the log-likelihood.\n\n\n\n §.§ Likelihood maximization\n\n\n\nWe implemented the calculation of the log-likelihood function l(α,K,b,γ) given by (<ref>) in Python.\nWe used numerical integration to obtain the integrals on the right-hand side of (<ref>).\nWe mention that the general integral formula in (<ref>) could not be used because the parameter a of the gamma–Gompertz distribution in the integrand depends on the integration variable on the right-hand side of (<ref>).\n\nIn order to maximize the value of the log-likelihood function l(α,K,b,γ) we applied the Nelder–Mead method\n<cit.> which is already implemented in Python.\nWe mention that initially we used the gamma–Gompertz–Makeham distribution as lifespan distribution, see (<ref>) for the definition, which contains the extra parameter c to be fitted but it turned out that the number of model parameters has to be reduced.\nThe behaviour of the optimization algorithm in the five parameters α,K,b,c,γ using the gamma–Gompretz–Makeham model was very similar the case of four parameters α,K,c,γ in the gamma–Gompertz model.\nRunning the optimization in the full set of parameters (α,K,b,c,γ in the gamma–Gompertz–Makeham model or α,K,b,γ in the gamma–Gompertz model), it turned out that after a few rounds the parameter K started to decrease dramatically and reached values below 10^-10.\nThe resulting lifespan distribution seemed very unrealistic with almost no mortality before the age of 100.\nThis happened for all values of the entry age E=0,30,60.\n\nWe explain this phenomenon by the fact that historical data about the oldest person in the world only gives information about the behaviour of the lifespan distribution between the ages 107 and 123.\nThe simple optimization in the four parameters α,K,b,γ simultaneously yields an excellent fit for the tail decay of the lifespan distribution with the historical data but the result may be very far from the actual human lifespan.\nThis would limit the practical relevance of our results.\n\nThe mathematical reason for the fact that the four-parameter optimization does not result in a satisfactory approximation to the human lifespan distribution is the following.\nIn these cases, the optimization procedure diverges to those regimes of the parameter space _+^4 where the corresponding gamma–Gompertz distribution is degenerate.\nOne can prevent reaching these unrealistic combinations of parameters by reducing the amount of freedom in the optimization.\nHence we specify some of the parameters a priori and we perform the optimization in the remaining ones so that it provides a good fit to the data on the age of the oldest old as well as a realistic lifespan distribution.\n\nWe believe that the most robust of the four parameters of the  model is b which is the exponent in the time dependence of the mortality rate.\nBy setting the rate of aging b=0.09 the algorithm gives the optimal triple α,K,γ with the best likelihood which is very stable under changing the initial values of these parameters.\nThe running time is also very short.\n\nThe Nelder–Mead algorithm, being a numerical maximization method, heavily relies on the tolerance parameter, which determines the minimal improvement required for the algorithm to continue running. If this parameter is set too high, the algorithm might stop before reaching the optimum. Conversely, if set too low, the algorithm might take excessively long to converge. To address this, we drew inspiration from dynamic learning rate algorithms used in neural network training and developed the following meta-algorithm.\n\nFirst, we run the Nelder–Mead optimization. Based on the improvement from the starting point, we dynamically adjust the tolerance factor, similar to how learning rates are modified during neural network training. We then run the optimization again, recalibrating the tolerance factor based on the observed improvement, and repeat the process. This iterative adjustment allows us to get closer to the optimum, a hypothesis supported by our practical experience with this meta-algorithm.\nFollowing this meta-algorithm, only a few calls of the Nelder–Mead method is enough to reach the optimum.\nThe Python codes for the likelihood calculations as well as the Nelder–Mead optimization implemented to this problem are available in <cit.>.\n\nThe numerical values of the resulting parameters for the three choices of the entry age are shown in Table <ref>.\nThe survival probability functions with the parameters given in Table <ref> for individuals born in 2000 corresponding to the entry age E=0,30,60 are shown on Figure <ref> as a function of the age.\nWe also computed the optimal values of the parameters α,K,γ for other values of the rate of aging b as a sensitivity analysis.\nThe resulting parameter values for the choices b=0.11, b=0.13 and b=0.15 are shown in Table <ref>.\n\n\n\nWe mention as an alternative approach that scaling the parameters could enhance the optimization process, but this requires prior knowledge of the range within which the parameters vary. This range could be determined through our iterative application of the Nelder–Mead algorithm.\n\n\n\n §.§ Computation of the oldest person's age and of the reign length\n\n\n\nWe observe that the model with the parameters in Table <ref> fits well to the titleholder data.\nWe focus on two statistics of the process in order to support this observation about the comparison:\nthe age of the world's oldest person and the reign length of the record holder.\nIn the case of both statistics exact formulas are only available for the homogeneous model introduced in Subsection <ref> where the birth rate is constant as well as the lifespan distribution does not depend on time.\nHence we apply an approximation where the error is negligible compared to the difference from the statistics computed using the data.\n\nIn the general model the distribution of the age of the world's oldest person at time t is given by the density h_t(x) in (<ref>) and by the point mass m_t at 0 in (<ref>).\nFor the numerical computations, we ignore the point mass m_t which is below the round-off error in the numerical results.\nThe difficulty in computing the mean age of the oldest person at time t is that parameter a of the gamma–Gompertz–Makeham distribution function F_t-u in the exponent of (<ref>) also depends on the integration variable u.\n\nIn our approximation we fix the value of the parameter a of the  distribution in h_t(x) in (<ref>) to a value which is equal to a_0(t-d) in (<ref>) with some delay d.\nThe delay d is chosen so that the mean age of the oldest person computed using a_0(t-d) as parameter a for all times in the  distribution function in (<ref>) is equal to the same value d.\nFor a given t, this value of d can be obtained as the fixed point of the contraction map\n\n    d↦∫_0^∞ xe^-∫_x^∞λ(t-u)(1-F_t-d(u)) ụλ(t-x)(1-F_t-d(x)) x̣\n\nwhich provides a reasonable approximation for the mean age of the world's oldest person.\nFor the comparison with the data and for the prediction, we use the model with entry age E=0.\nHence in (<ref>), the function λ is given in (<ref>) with E=0 and F_t-d is the  distribution function with parameters given by the E=0 values in Table <ref> and with a=a_0(t-d) in (<ref>).\nThis approximation is reasonable because the distribution of the age of the oldest person is highly concentrated.\n\nThe fixed point of the map in (<ref>) as the expected age of the world's oldest person can be found in a few steps of iterations.\nWe show the result on Figure <ref>.\nWe applied 10 iterations using the fitted model parameters for each year between 1955 and 2019.\nBy computing the standard deviation of the age of the oldest person as well we obtain the mean and a confidence interval for the age.\n\nThe predictions for the age distribution of the world's oldest person in the future shown on Figure <ref>.\nWe obtained them by using the exact age distribution formula in Subsection <ref> along with the numerical values of the parameters C,κ,α,K,γ given in Tables <ref> and <ref> for entry age E=0.\n\nIn our model, the distribution function of the age of the world's oldest person is given in (<ref>) where the  distribution function can be substituted with the estimated parameter values at any time.\nIn this way, the probability of observing an age greater than or equal to Calment's or Knauss' actual age at the time of their death can be computed exactly.\nThe numerical values are 0.000286 for Calment and it is 0.0116 for Knauss.\n\nThe backtesting mentioned in the Results section is performed as follows.\nWe estimated the best parameter values with entry age 0 based on the reduced data on the world's oldest person between 1955 and 1988 where the ending date is the time when Calment became the world's oldest person.\nThe resulting parameters α=0.01516,K=0.00002064,γ=0.08413 are numerically not very far from the optimal parameters in Table <ref> but the difference is more visible on Figure <ref>.\nThe figure shows the model-based mean age and confidence interval for the age of the world's oldest person computed using the full data as well as the data until 1988.\n\nFor the reign length of record holders, we again used the expected age at a given time obtained as the fixed point of the iteration in (<ref>).\nThe numerical value of the expected reign length obtained from the iteration is 1.195 in 1955 and it is 1.188 in 2019.\nThe empirical value of the reign length is 1.008 computed from the data by dividing the total length of the time interval between 1955 and 2019 by the number of record holders.\n\n\n\n§ METHODS\n\n\n\nIn this section, we provide supplementary information related to the main result of this paper.\nWe perform explicit computations with the gamma–Gompertz–Makeham model\nand we express the integral of the survival function in terms of a hypergeometric function.\n\nThe cumulative distribution function and the density of the gamma–Gompertz–Makeham () distribution are given by\n\n    F^_a,b,c,γ(x)   =1-e^-cx/(1+aγ/b(e^bx-1))^1/γ,\n    \n    f^_a,b,c,γ(x)   =e^-cx/(1+aγ/b(e^bx-1))^1+1/γc(b-aγ)+a(b+cγ)e^bx/b\n\nfor x≥0 where a,b,c,γ are positive parameters.\nThe positivity of parameters implies the finiteness of all moments and, in particular, the convergence of the integral of the survival function\n∫_x^∞(1-F^_a,b,c,γ(u)) ụ.\nIn the homogeneous model, the integral of the survival function appears in the density of the distribution of Y_t in (<ref>) and in the stationary density of the peaks process in (<ref>).\nWe show below that in the gamma–Gompertz–Makeham model the integral of the survival function can be computed explicitly and it is given by\n\n    ∫_x^∞(1-F^_a,b,c,γ(u))ụ\n    =( b/a γ)^1/γe^-(c+b/γ)x/b/γ+c_2F_1(1/γ,1/γ+c/b;1+1/γ+c/b;a γ-b/a γe^-bx)\n\nwhere _2F_1(a,b;c;z) is the hypergeometric function.\nSee 15.1.1 in <cit.> for the definition and properties.\n\nWe prove (<ref>) based on the following integral representation 15.3.1 in <cit.> of the hypergeometric function\n\n    _2F_1(a,b,c,z)=Γ(c)/Γ(b) Γ(c-b)∫_0^1 t^b-1(1-t)^c-b-1(1-tz)^-a ṭ\n\nwhich holds whenever (c)>(b)>0.\nFirst we prove an identity for complex parameters α,β,δ which satisfy (α+β)>0 and we compute\n\n    ∫_x^∞e^-β u/(1+δ e^u)^α ụ   =1/δ^α∫_x^∞e^-(α+β)u/(1+e^-u/δ)^α ụ\n       =e^-(α+β)x/δ^α∫_0^1 y^α+β-1(1+e^-xy/δ)^-α ỵ\n       =e^-(α+β)x/(α+β)δ^α·_2F_1(α,α+β;1+α+β;-e^-x/δ)\n\nwhere we applied a change of variables y=e^x-u in the second equality above and we applied the hypergeometric identity (<ref>) in the last equality with a=α, b=α+β, c=1+α+β, z=-e^-x/δ together with the observation that with these values of the parameters the prefactor of the integral on the right-hand side of (<ref>) simplifies to α+β.\nNote that the condition (c)>(b)>0 for (<ref>) to hold is satisfied by our assumption (α+β)>0 which also makes the integrals in (<ref>) convergent.\n\nNext we show (<ref>) using (<ref>) as follows.\nWe write\n\n    ∫_x^∞(1-F^_a,b,c,γ(u)) ụ   =1/(1-aγ/b)^1/γ∫_x^∞e^-cu/(1+aγ/b-aγe^bu)^1/γ ụ\n       =1/(1-aγ/b)^1/γb∫_bx^∞e^-cv/b/(1+aγ/b-aγe^v)^1/γ ṿ\n       =1/(1-aγ/b)^1/γbe^-(1/γ+c/b)bx/(1/γ+c/b)(aγ/b-aγ)^1/γ_2F_1(1/γ,1/γ+c/b;1+1/γ+c/b;a γ-b/a γe^-bx)\n\nwhere we applied the change of variables v=bu in the second equality above and we used (<ref>) with α=1/γ, β=c/b, δ=aγ/(b-aγ) and with x replaced by bx.\nThe right-hand side of (<ref>) simplifies to that of (<ref>).\n\n10\nrm\nurl<#>1urlprefixURL doiprefixDOI: \n\n\nOepVau02\nauthorOeppen, J. & authorVaupel, J. W.\njournaltitleBroken limits to life expectancy.\nScience volume296,\n  pages1029–1031

As life expectancy rises and deaths shift to older ages, understanding the distribution of deaths among the oldest-old becomes increasingly important for various stakeholders. While adult human mortality patterns have been described, debates persist regarding the exact distribution of deaths at older ages and the existence of a mortality plateau. If such a plateau exists, it implies a gamma-Gompertz distribution and suggests no upper limit to human lifespan.

On the examples of energy and charge diffusion in 1D spin chains and sudden quench dynamics in the 2D transverse-field Ising model, it is shown that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art tensor network methods. We further demonstrate the flexibility of the approach by studying quench dynamics in the 3D transverse-field Ising model which is highly challenging for tensor network methods.\nFor the simulation of expectation value dynamics starting in a computational basis state, we introduce an extension of sparse Pauli dynamics that truncates the growing sum of Pauli operators by discarding terms with a large number of X and Y matrices. This is validated by our 2D and 3D simulations. Finally, we argue that sparse Pauli dynamics is not only capable of converging challenging observables to high accuracy, but can also serve as a reliable approximate approach even when given only limited computational resources.\n\n\nReal-time operator evolution in two and three dimensions via sparse Pauli dynamics\n    Garnet Kin-Lic Chan\n    September 9, 2024\n==================================================================================\n\n\n\n./figures/\n\n\n\n§ INTRODUCTION\n\n\nNumerical simulations of quantum dynamics are essential for our understanding of strongly correlated many-body physics. For large systems and long-time dynamics, exact state-vector or tensor network contraction <cit.> methods become computationally intractable and approximate numerical methods are required. These can be formulated in different pictures, for example, the Schrödinger picture, where the state is evolved, or the Heisenberg picture, where the state is unchanged and time evolution is applied to the observable.\n\nOperator time evolution appears naturally in the dynamics of high-temperature systems <cit.> and the theory of operator spreading <cit.>, and has proven useful in the computation of time-correlation functions <cit.> and out-of-time-order correlations <cit.>. Compared to the Schrödinger picture, working in the Heisenberg picture has the benefit that one can take advantage of the dynamical light-cone structure, i.e., the fact that the support of some relevant observables is initially local and grows in time. Operator time evolution has been the subject of tensor network studies, e.g., those based on matrix-product operators (MPO) <cit.> or projected entangled-pair operators (PEPO) <cit.>, whose performance depends on the degree of operator entanglement in the evolved observable.\n\nAlternative Heisenberg-picture methods have been formulated to take advantage of the sparsity of the observable in the Pauli operator representation. \n\nUnder time evolution, local observables spread to a superposition of an increasing number of Pauli operators, and \nvarious strategies to curb the (at worst) exponential growth of the number of Pauli operators have been employed, including stochastic sampling of Pauli paths <cit.> or discarding Pauli paths based on Pauli weights <cit.>, perturbation order with respect to the nearest Clifford transformation <cit.>, Fourier order <cit.>, or combinations thereof <cit.>. These methods have mainly been developed in the context of simulating quantum circuit expectation values, where the number of Pauli operators can be low due to the use of Clifford gates or noise <cit.>.\n\nHere, we consider one of these methods, namely the sparse Pauli dynamics (SPD) <cit.>, which was applied successfully recently to simulate the kicked transverse-field Ising model quantum simulation of Ref. <cit.>. There, we showed that it can simulate the expectation values faster than the quantum device to reach comparable accuracy and that, given more time, can produce more accurate results than the quantum processor.  These simulations also demonstrated that SPD performs well compared to other classical simulation strategies based on state <cit.> and operator evolution <cit.>. In this work, we analyze its performance in simulating real-time dynamics on 1D spin chains, where we compare it to MPO dynamics including its recent dissipation assisted variant <cit.>, as well as in the transverse-field Ising model on square (2D) and cubic (3D) lattices, where we use available 2D tensor network simulation benchmarks. For the latter, we introduce a modification of the original method that further reduces the computational cost of simulating time-dependent expectation values when the initial state is a computational basis state (e.g., | 0^⊗ n⟩).\n\n\n\n§ REAL-TIME SPARSE PAULI DYNAMICS\n\n\nIn SPD we write the observable operator\n\n    O = ∑_P ∈𝒫 a_P P\n\nas a sum of Pauli operators P with complex coefficients a_P, where 𝒫 is a set of Pauli operators that contribute to O. The central part of our algorithm is the action of a Pauli rotation operator U_σ(θ) = exp(-i θσ / 2) on the observable (<ref>):\n\n    Õ = U_σ(θ)^† O U_σ(θ) = ∑_P ∈𝒫_C a_P P + ∑_P ∈𝒫_A (a_P cos(θ) P + i a_P sin(θ) σ· P),\n\nwhich follows from\n\n    U_σ(θ)^† P U_σ(θ) = \n            P,                        [P, σ] = 0, \n    cos(θ) P + i sin(θ) σ· P,   {P, σ} = 0,\n\nwhere [·, ·] denotes a commutator and {·, ·} an anticommutator. In Eq. (<ref>), 𝒫_C (𝒫_A) is a set of Pauli operators in 𝒫 that commute (anticommute) with σ. The right-hand side of Eq. (<ref>) can be brought into the form of Eq. (<ref>) by identifying which σ· P already exist in 𝒫 and which have to be added to represent the rotated observable Õ. In general, the number of Pauli operators that we have to store, N = |𝒫|, grows exponentially with the number of unitary Pauli rotation operators applied. To limit the growth of N, we replace the exactly rotated observable Õ by\n\n    Õ_δ = Π_δ (Õ),\n\nwhere Π_δ acts by discarding all Pauli operators P with |a_P| < δ. Here, the threshold δ defines the approximation error, i.e., δ = 0 corresponds to exact dynamics. In practice, the goal is to converge the simulation with respect to this tunable parameter. Additional implementation details can be found in Appendix <ref>.\n\nFor real-time dynamics under a Hamiltonian\n\n    H = ∑_j c_j H_j,\n\nwhere c_j are real coefficients and H_j are Pauli operators, we replace the exact time-evolution operator U_Δ t = exp(- i H Δ t), corresponding to a time step Δ t, by the first-order Trotter splitting formula\n\n    U_Δ t≈∏_j exp(- i c_j Δ t H_j).\n\nNow the real-time evolution takes the form of applying multiple Pauli rotation gates, which allows us to use the SPD method as defined above. The size of the time step determines not only the Trotter error in Eq. (<ref>) but also the truncation error in SPD. Specifically, for small values of threshold δ and time step Δ t, the error is a function of their ratio δ / Δ t. To show this, let us consider one substep of the dynamics in which we apply one Pauli rotation operator exp(- i c_j Δ t H_j) to the observable (<ref>), the result of which is shown in Eq. (<ref>) with θ = 2 c_j Δ t. For a sufficiently small time step, we can expand Eq. (<ref>) up to first order in Δ t,\n\n    Õ≈∑_P ∈𝒫_C a_P P + ∑_P ∈𝒫_A (a_P  P + 2 i a_P c_j Δ t σ· P) = O + 2 i c_j Δ t ∑_P ∈𝒫_A a_P H_j · P.\n\nFor small threshold δ, we can assume that the threshold-based truncation will mainly discard Pauli operators H_j · P that do not already exist in O. The condition under which they are discarded reads |2 c_j Δ t a_P| < δ, i.e., |a_P| < (δ / Δ t) / 2|c_j|. Consequently, the truncation error and the number of Pauli operators depend only on the ratio δ / Δ t. Since the number of Pauli operators determines the computational cost per time step, it is generally preferred to use a larger time step—at fixed δ / Δ t, the cost per time step is constant, but a larger time step requires less steps to reach a given total time. In turn, the size of the time step is limited by the Trotter error, which must be validated before converging the calculation with respect to truncation threshold δ.\n\n\n\n§ RESULTS\n\n\n\n\n §.§ Spin and energy diffusion constants in 1D chains\n\n\nWe begin with the computation of diffusion constants of conserved densities in spin chains of length L at infinite temperature. The diffusion constant <cit.>\n\n    D = 1/2∂/∂ t d^2(t)\n\nis defined through the time-derivative of the mean-square displacement\n\n    d^2(t) = ∑_j C_j(t) j^2 - ( ∑_j C_j(t) j )^2,\n\nwhere\n\n    C_j(t) = Tr[q_j q_L+1/2(t)]/{∑_j Tr[q_j q_L+1/2(0)] }\n\nare the dynamical correlations between the operators q localized at the central site (L+1)/2 and sites j. These operators represent conserved densities in the sense that ∑_j q_j(t) = ∑_j q_j(0), which leads to ∑_j C_j(t) = ∑_j C_j(0) = 1.\n\nThis problem is naturally formulated in the Heisenberg picture and we employ SPD to numerically evolve q_L+1/2(t) in time. Within the sparse Pauli representation of the operator, it is also easy to evaluate the overlap with another Pauli operator (or a sum of Pauli operators) q_j (see Appendix <ref>). Since the conservation laws are not strictly obeyed by the non-unitary truncation scheme employed in SPD, we replace the denominator in Eq. (<ref>) by ∑_j Tr[q_j q_L+1/2(t)], i.e., we renormalize the correlations at post-processing.\n\n\n\n  §.§.§ Models\n\n\nBelow, we introduce the examples of Ref. <cit.>, which were studied using dissipation assisted operator evolution (DAOE) combined with a MPO representation of the operator. There, the authors introduced an artificial dissipator that reduces the entanglement of the said MPO and demonstrated that this computational strategy is well founded for the simulation of diffusive transport at high temperature.\n\nThe first example is the one-dimensional tilted-field Ising model <cit.>\n\n    H = ∑_j=1^L-1 Z_j Z_j+1 + ∑_j=1^L (1.4 X_j + 0.9045 Z_j)\n\n with open boundary conditions, while the conserved densities are the local energies\n \n    q_j = 1/2 Z_j-1 Z_j + 1/2 Z_j Z_j+1 + 1.4 X_j + 0.9054 Z_j.\n\nL=51 is the number of sites in the chain.\n\nThe second model is the XX-ladder Hamiltonian <cit.>\n\n    H = 1/4∑_j=1^L-1∑_a=1,2 (X_j,a X_j+1, a + Y_j,a Y_j+1,a) + 1/4∑_j=1^L (X_j,1 X_j, 2 + Y_j,1 Y_j,2),\n\nwhere the total spin is a conserved property and we consider the diffusion of q_j = (Z_j,1 + Z_j,2)/2 along the chain of length L=41 (number of sites is n=2L=82).\n\nFor these two models, we simulated the mean-square displacement (<ref>) for a total time of t = 20, with a time step of Δ t = 0.02, unless stated otherwise. The diffusion constant was computed by linear regression of d^2(t) between t=10 and t=20.\n\n\n\n  §.§.§ Numerical results\n\n\nFigure <ref> shows the mean-square displacements for the tilted-field Ising (panel A) and XX-ladder models (panel C), simulated using SPD with different values of the threshold δ ranging from 2^-18 to 2^-13. We can observe how d^2(t) converges onto a straight line at large t as we reduce the threshold and make the simulations more accurate. Figures <ref>B, D plot the corresponding diffusion constant as a function δ/Δ t for two sets of data, one using Δ t = 0.01 and the other using Δ t = 0.02. For this property, the results are amenable to an extrapolation in δ→ 0, and we find D ≈ 1.4 for the tilted-field Ising chain (same value was reported in Ref. <cit.>), while D ≈ 0.94 for the XX-ladder (compared to D ≈ 0.95 of Ref. <cit.> and D ≈ 0.96-0.98 reported in Ref. <cit.>). The plots of the diffusion constant also reveal the scaling relationship discussed in Sec. <ref>. Namely, as the threshold is reduced, the simulations using different δ and Δ t but the same δ / Δ t become closer to each other. In addition, we can numerically verify that using a larger time step reduces the computational cost. For example, the two points in Fig. <ref>D at fixed δ / Δ t = 2^-18/0.02 ≈ 0.00019 take around 84h (Δ t = 0.01, blue circle) and 43h (Δ t = 0.02, orange square) to simulate on 6 cores.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate that the above problems are non-trivial to simulate, we present a comparison between SPD and matrix-product operator (MPO) dynamics without dissipation assistance (Fig. <ref>, see details in Appendix <ref>), a standard method for 1D dynamics.\nUsing a MPO bond dimension up to χ=2^9 we find that the MPO simulations are still far from the exact results even for shorter chains (L=9-21) of the tilted-field Ising model, whereas SPD is more accurate already at rather large values of δ. Similarly, Ref. <cit.> reported that the MPO dynamics of the L=51 chain with bond dimension χ = 2^9 diverges from the exact result already at t=8. For the same system, SPD is visually well converged up to t=15 already at δ = 2^-15.\n\n\n\n\nIn the remainder of this Section, we analyze the operator evolution in terms of contributions from Pauli operators of different weights. Here, the Pauli weight is defined as the number of non-identity Pauli matrices in a Pauli operator. To this end, for any operator O=∑_P ∈𝒫 a_P P, we introduce F_m = ∑_P ∈𝒫_m |a_P|^2, where 𝒫_m ⊆𝒫 is a subset of Pauli operators with Pauli weight m. Then the sum F = ∑_m=1^n F_m is constant for unitary dynamics and equal to the square of the Frobenius norm, i.e., F = Tr(O^†O)/2^n. Figure <ref>A shows the breakdown of F into individual components F_m (up to m=12) for the example of tilted-field Ising model [Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>)], demonstrating how the dynamics evolves initially low-weight Pauli operators into a sum of operators with higher weights. After some time, F of the operator evolved with SPD deviates from its initial value because of threshold-based truncation. This truncation appears to affect high-weight Pauli operators more than the low-weight Paulis. This is confirmed in Fig. <ref>B, where we show F_m contributions for m up to 5. As shown in previous works <cit.>, Pauli operators corresponding to the local conserved quantity (here m=1 and m=2 for the local energy (<ref>)) obey the long-time scaling F_m ∼ t^-1/2, whereas other Pauli operators (here m>2) obey F_m ∼ t^-3/2 in the long-time limit.\n\n\n\nThis observation motivates methods that truncate the time-evolved operator based on Pauli weights, including the dissipation assisted operator evolution (DAOE) approach <cit.>, low-weight simulation algorithm (LOWESA) <cit.> and observable's back-propagation on Pauli paths (OBPPP) <cit.>, two approaches that were originally developed for the simulation of noisy quantum circuits, and the restricted state space approximation <cit.>, introduced in the context of simulating nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Our results indicate that SPD can take advantage of such behavior without explicitly truncating the sum based on Pauli weights because high-weight Pauli operators appear with small coefficients that do not meet the threshold criterion.\n\n\n\n §.§ Time-dependent expectation values\n\n\n\n\n  §.§.§ X-truncated sparse Pauli dynamics\n\n\nIn the examples above, we focused on infinite-temperature time-correlation functions of a time-evolved operator with a local, low-weight Pauli operator. Here, we consider expectation values of the form ⟨ O ⟩_t = ⟨ 0^⊗ n | O(t) | 0^⊗ n⟩, where high-weight Pauli operators can contribute as long as they are composed only of identity and Z matrices (i.e., if they are diagonal in the computational basis). Default Heisenberg evolution does not account for the information about the state over which we take the expectation value but rather treats all Pauli operators equally. Within the framework of SPD, this means that we keep a large number of Pauli operators, of which only a fraction contribute to the observable.\n\nTo further truncate the number of Pauli operators without introducing large errors in the expectation value ⟨ O ⟩_t, we propose to discard Pauli operators composed of more than M X or Y Pauli matrices. We refer to the number of X/Y matrices as the X-weight of a Pauli operator and we call this additional truncation scheme X-truncated SPD (xSPD). The truncation introduces the additional assumption that for certain (short) times, there is limited operator backflow from high X-weight Paulis to the manifold of Z-type Pauli operators. For each calculation, we test the value of M to ensure that the error introduced by the X-truncation scheme is sufficiently small (for example, smaller than the target convergence criterion). The X-truncation is applied only every T steps of the dynamics to limit the impact on the accuracy. In our calculations, we fixed T to 5 steps. Finally, we note here that alternatives to our hard M cutoff could also be considered, such as introducing an artificial dissipator based on the Pauli's X-weight that would be similar in spirit to DAOE <cit.>.\n\nIn the following, we apply this modification of the original SPD method to dynamics in the 2D (square lattice) and 3D (cubic lattice) transverse-field Ising models described by the Hamiltonian\n\n    H = -∑_⟨ j k ⟩ X_j X_k - h ∑_j=1^L  Z_j,\n\nwhere the first sum runs over nearest neighbors on the lattice with open boundary conditions and h controls the magnitude of the field. We consider the time-dependent magnetization ⟨ Z⟩_t = ⟨ 0^⊗ n| Z_0(t) |0^⊗ n⟩, where Z_0 denotes the Z Pauli operator on the central site. Physically this corresponds to the magnetization induced after a sudden quench from infinite h to a finite value of h.\n\nIn this setting, the first-order Trotter splitting\n\n    U^(1)(t) = [e^ i Δ t ∑_⟨ j k ⟩ X_j X_k e^ i h Δ t ∑_j=1^L  Z_j]^K,\n\nwhere K = t/Δ t is the number of time steps, is equivalent to the second-order splitting\n\n    U^(2)(t)    =   [e^ i 1/2 h Δ t ∑_j=1^L  Z_j e^ i Δ t ∑_⟨ j k ⟩ X_j X_k e^ i 1/2 h Δ t ∑_j=1^L  Z_j]^K \n       =    e^ i 1/2 h Δ t ∑_j=1^L  Z_j U^(1)(t) e^ - i 1/2 h Δ t ∑_j=1^L  Z_j\n\nbecause Z-Pauli rotations commute with the observable and apply only a phase to the initial state.\n\n\n\n  §.§.§ 2D transverse-field Ising model\n\n\nThe quantum quench dynamics of magnetization in the 2D transverse-field Ising model has been studied by means of infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) <cit.> and neural network quantum state <cit.> calculations. While the iPEPS simulations correspond to dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, neural network simulations were performed on a 10 × 10 lattice, which was shown to be sufficiently large to exhibit negligible finite-size effects <cit.>. In our simulations, we used an 11 × 11 square lattice. We set h=h_c, where h_c = 3.04438(2) corresponds to the quantum critical point <cit.>, and simulate the magnetization up to t = 0.92, where we can compare our results to different update schemes used in iPEPS simulations, namely the full update (FU) <cit.>, neighborhood tensor update (NTU) <cit.>, and gradient tensor update (GTU) <cit.>.\n\nFigure <ref> shows the convergence of xSPD with respect to the threshold δ. As expected, the method converges quickly at short times but requires small values of δ to converge the values at longer times. Our most accurate simulation agrees well with FU and GTU iPEPS results, and shows some deviation from the NTU scheme at the end of the simulation time. \nWe note that although the NTU iPEPS calculation corresponds to the largest bond dimension amongst the iPEPS data, the accuracy of truncation is also believed to be less than for the FU iPEPS simulation, thus the relative accuracy of the different reference iPEPS data is unclear.\nThe disagreement between the two smallest δ xSPD simulations at the end of the simulation time is only 0.002 (0.007 over the 3 smallest δs) which provides an estimate of the threshold error. This threshold error is comparable to the estimated Trotter and X-truncation errors (discussed below).\n\n\n\nIn this example, we employed a time step of Δ t = 0.04 and set the X-truncation parameter to M=5. To validate this choice of parameters, we analyze the associated errors in Fig. <ref>. Specifically, for the time step (Fig. <ref>A), we set δ / Δ t = 2^-19/0.01  = 1.90734 × 10^-4 and compute the observable using three different time steps. We estimate that the Trotter error is below 0.003 within the simulated time of t=0.92. Similarly, we perform SPD and xSPD simulations with varying values of M, using δ=2^-20. We estimate that the error due to M=5 X-truncation is about 0.003. In contrast, employing M=7 would lead to almost no error but also limited computational savings, while M=3 produces an error that is greater than our convergence target of less than 0.01. Note that due to symmetry, all Pauli operators appear with an even X-weight, which is why we only consider odd values of M.\n\n\n\nRegarding the computational cost, the most accurate simulation at δ = 2^-23 generated up to 8.5 billion Pauli operators, used over 1TB of memory, and took around 36 hours on 16 CPU cores. For comparison, the least accurate simulation shown in Fig. <ref>, corresponding to δ = 2^-18, generated at most 84 million Pauli operators in 32 minutes on 16 CPU cores.\n\n\n\n  §.§.§ 3D transverse-field Ising model\n\n\nAs our final example, we present the quench dynamics of magnetization for spins on a simple cubic lattice with L=11 and n=L^3=1331 sites. Here we consider two values of h, h=1 (weak field) and h=5.15813(6) (critical point). \n\nIn the case of h=1, using Δ t = 0.04 and M=7, we could run the dynamics up to t=1 with thresholds as low as 2^-19 (see Fig. <ref>). The most accurate simulations (δ≤ 2^-17) agree to within ≈ 0.02, which is comparable to the estimated time step (Trotter) and X-truncation errors (see Fig. <ref>A, C in Appendix <ref>). Interestingly, even the fastest, least-accurate simulation (δ=2^-14) exhibits “qualitative accuracy”, i.e., recovers the general trend of the most accurate available result. We ascribe this to the fact that sparse Pauli representation can easily reproduce the dynamics dominated by few Pauli operators. However, the method struggles to include small contributions from many Pauli operators generated by the time evolution. For example, while only about 10^6 Pauli operators are generated at threshold δ=2^-14 after 1 time unit, around 7 × 10^8 Pauli operators are generated during the same dynamics with a threshold of δ=2^-19. Yet, the difference in the observable appears limited to around 0.04.\n\nThe system with h=5.158136 (Fig. <ref>B) was propagated up to t=0.6 using Δ t= 0.02 and M=5. For this choice of parameters, the Trotter and X-truncation errors are estimated to be below 0.005 (see Fig. <ref>B, D in Appendix <ref>). Because of the shorter dynamics we could use a smaller value of the X-truncation parameter M compared to the weak-field case. The results, using thresholds as low as δ=2^-20, are converged to below 0.01 for times t<0.5, after which our most accurate simulations begin to deviate from each other.\n\nIn general, these 3D calculations are expected to pose challenges for tensor network techniques, which for a fixed bond dimension show an exponential scaling with the connectivity of the lattice (assuming site tensors with a number of bonds equal to the number of neighbours). Although SPD does not show this exponential scaling, the 3D simulations for a given side-length L are still more costly than the 2D ones, primarily because the number of sites n=L^3 is a factor of L larger than in the 2D case.\nFor these reasons, we cannot simulate as many Pauli operators as in the 2D case. Specifically, our memory budget of about 1.5TB is reached already with less than 10^9 Pauli operators, an order of magnitude less than in our 2D square lattice simulations. With this number of Pauli operators, the computation with h=1 takes around 73 h on 16 CPU cores, about two times longer than our most accurate 2D calculation. Nonetheless, the relative feasibility of these simulations illustrate the kinds of systems that can be (approximately) studied by SPD dynamics that would otherwise be challenging to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\n  §.§.§ Computational savings from X-truncation\n\n\nWe now analyze the savings due to the X-truncation scheme. Figures <ref>A, B show the number of Pauli operators as a function of time for 2D and 3D simulations. While the number of Pauli operators in xSPD is suppressed by the X-truncation, the number of Z-type operators (Pauli operators composed only of Z and identity matrices) is almost the same as in SPD. Since the total cost of the computation is proportional to the number of all Pauli operators N, we can use the ratio N_ SPD/N_ xSPD to quantify the computational savings (Fig. <ref>C). We observe a factor of 6 decrease in the number of Pauli operators in the 2D case, and up to a factor of 5 for the 3D simulation. Such savings allow a factor of 2–4 lower thresholds compared to the original SPD. For example, within a budget of a few days and 1.5 TB of memory, the most accurate SPD calculation we could run for the 2D system would be limited to δ=2^-21, which is not converged with respect to threshold at the longest simulated times (see Fig. <ref>). In contrast, with xSPD we could afford to run the same simulation with δ=2^-23.\n\n\n\n\n\n§ CONCLUSION\n\n\nTo conclude, we have presented numerical simulations of real-time operator evolution with SPD and its modified version, xSPD. We have shown that, in systems for which reference data is available, the performance of these methods is at the level of state-of-the-art tensor network approaches, while the flexibility and simplicity of SPD allows for applications to dynamics problems where tensor network approaches have yet to make an impact, such as in 3D lattices. For the studied systems, we found that we can obtain very accurate results either by converging the observables in the case of short-time, 2D and 3D transverse field Ising model dynamics, or by extrapolating to zero threshold for the long-time diffusion coefficients in 1D chains. Apart from reaching quantitatively converged results for these challenging examples of time-dependent observables, we also found that SPD could serve as a practical method for computing qualitatively accurate results. In this respect, our work motivates further research into using sparse Pauli representations for real-time quantum dynamics.\n\n\nWe thank Jacek Dziarmaga for sharing the iPEPS simulation data presented in Fig. <ref> and Huanchen Zhai for help with setting up MPO simulations presented in Fig. <ref>.\nThe authors were supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program under Award Number DE-SC0022088.

Briefly, a sum of N Pauli operators is stored in the form of three arrays: an array of N complex coefficients a, an array of N integer phases φ, and a N × 2n_64 array of 64-bit unsigned integers that stores two bitstrings x and z for each Pauli operator:\n\n    O = ∑_j=0^N-1 a_j (-i)^φ∏_k=0^n-1 Z_k^z_jk X_k^x_jk.\n\nThe number of unsigned integers needed to store n bits is n_64 = ⌈ n ⌉. Pauli operators are sorted using lexicographic ordering on the bitstrings. In this way, we can find the position j of a given Pauli operator in the sum—or the position at which to insert a new Pauli operator so that the ordering is preserved—in 𝒪(log N) time. Similarly, deleting Pauli operators preserves the order trivially.\n\nApart from searching, inserting, and deleting Pauli operators, other key operations on this sparse representation of a sum of Pauli operators include identifying which Pauli operators in the sum anticommute with a given Pauli operator and multiplying the sum of Pauli operators by a Pauli. For the anticommutation of Pauli operators A and B, we have\n\n    A  anticommutes with  B = z_A · x_B - x_A · z_B.\n \nHere the multiplications on the right-hand side correspond to the AND logical operator between bits and additions to the XOR logical operator (addition in ℤ_2). The product of two Pauli operators C = A B is given by\n\n    (z_C, x_C)    =    (z_A + z_B, x_A + x_B), \n    φ_C    =   φ_A + φ_B + 2 z_A · x_B, \n    \n        a_C    =    a_A a_B.\n\n\nIn Sec. <ref>, we also introduced an overlap (inner product) between sums of Pauli operators Tr[O_1^† O_2]/2^n represented in the sparse Pauli format described above. Let us assume that N_1 < N_2, i.e., that O_1 has fewer Pauli operators than O_2. Then, we can search for all Pauli operators of O_1 in O_2 in 𝒪(N_1 log N_2) time and the overlap is \n\n    1/2^nTr[O_1^† O_2] = ∑_j (-i)^φ_2, k[j] - φ_1, j a_1, j^∗ a_2, k[j],\n\nwhere the sum runs over Pauli operators in O_1 that were found in O_2 and k[j] is the index of the j-th found Pauli in O_2. The expectation over the all-zero state, as needed in Sec. <ref>, can be computed as\n\n    ⟨ 0^⊗ n | O | 0^⊗ n⟩ = ∑_j a_j (-i)^φ_j,\n\nwhere the sum runs over Z-type Pauli operators (for which all bits in x_j are 0). Finally, the X-weight of an operator is computed as the number of set bits in the corresponding x array.\n\nFor convenience, our implementation interfaces to Qiskit <cit.> for setting up the calculations. Specifically, it converts Qiskit's SparsePauliOp into our representation described above that is then used in the simulations.\n\n\n\n§ DETAILS OF MPO SIMULATIONS\n\n\nMPO simulations were performed using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) method, as implemented in the Block2 code <cit.>. After constructing the MPO of the observable at time zero, we convert it to an MPS | O with a doubled number of sites, i.e., ⟨ i_1 i_2 … | O | j_1 j_2 …⟩ / 2^n/2 =  i_1 j_1 i_2 j_2 … | O. The sites of the MPS are ordered so that the two physical legs of a single site in the MPO appear on neighboring sites in the MPS. The Liouvillian superoperator L |O≡ [H, O] that governs the dynamics of the observable is then represented as an MPO in the extended Hilbert space with twice as many sites. Specifically, each Pauli operator in the Hamiltonian corresponds to a sum of two Pauli operators in the Liouvillian. For single-site Pauli operators σ_i ∈{I, X, Y, Z} at site i, we have σ_2i - σ_2i+1, while the nearest-neighbor interaction terms σ_i σ_i+1 correspond to σ_2iσ_2i+2 - σ_2i+1σ_2i+3 in the superoperator picture.\n\nThe initial observable MPS is propagated with the Liouvillian MPO using the time-step-targeting method <cit.> and a time step of Δ t = 0.04. The correlation functions of the form Tr[O_1^† O_2]/2^n, used in Eq. (<ref>), were evaluated as the inner product O_1 | O_2 of the two matrix product states.\n\n\n\n§ TIME STEP AND X-TRUNCATION PARAMETERS IN 3D SIMULATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\nfxundefined [1]\n ifx#1\n\nfnum [1]\n #1firstoftwo\n secondoftwo\n \nfx [1]\n #1firstoftwo\n secondoftwo\n \n\n\n\n\n\nnoop [0]secondoftwo\n\nref[1]@startlink#1@href\nhref[1]#1@endlink\nanitize@url [0]`\n12`$12`&12`#12`1̂2`_12`%12\nstartlink[1]\nendlink[0]\n\nrl [1]href #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@bib@innerbibempty\n\n[Gray and Kourtis(2021)]gray2021hyper\n  author author J. Gray and author S. Kourtis,  title title Hyper-optimized tensor network\n  contraction, @noop  journal journal\n  Quantum volume 5, pages 410\n  (year 2021)NoStop\n[Huang et al.(2021)Huang,\n  Zhang, Newman, Ni,\n  Ding, Cai, Gao, Wang, Wu, Zhang et al.]huang2021efficient\n  author author C. Huang, author F. Zhang,\n  author M. Newman, author X. Ni, author\n  D. Ding, author J. Cai, author X. Gao, author T. Wang, author F. Wu, author\n  G. Zhang, et al., title title Efficient parallelization of tensor network\n  contraction for simulating quantum computation, @noop  journal journal Nature Computational Science volume 1, pages 578 (year\n  2021)NoStop\n[Gray and Chan(2024)]gray2022hyper\n  author author J. Gray and author G. K.-L.

It demonstrates the method's competitive performance with state-of-the-art tensor network methods through examples of energy and charge diffusion in 1D spin chains and sudden quench dynamics in the 2D transverse-field Ising model. Additionally, the study showcases the method's flexibility by applying it to quench dynamics in the 3D transverse-field Ising model, a task challenging for tensor network methods. An extension of sparse Pauli dynamics is introduced, which truncates the sum of Pauli operators by discarding terms with numerous X and Y matrices, validated through 2D and 3D simulations.

For large systems and extended time dynamics, exact methods such as state-vector or tensor network contraction become computationally infeasible, necessitating approximate numerical methods. These methods can be framed in the Schrödinger picture, where the state evolves, or the Heisenberg picture, where the state remains static and time evolution is applied to the observables.\n\nOperator time evolution is significant in high-temperature system dynamics and the theory of operator spreading, aiding in the computation of time-correlation functions and out-of-time-order correlations. The Heisenberg picture is advantageous due to the dynamical light-cone structure, where the support of relevant observables grows over time. This approach has been"

The diffusion constant is derived from the time-derivative of the mean-square displacement of dynamical correlations between conserved density operators. Numerical simulations are conducted using sparse Pauli dynamics (SPD) and matrix-product operator (MPO) methods for two models: the tilted-field Ising model and the XX-ladder Hamiltonian.\n\nFor the Ising model and XX-ladder, diffusion constants are calculated by simulating mean-square displacements over time, with linear regression applied between t=10 and t=20. The results show that diffusion constants converge as the simulation threshold δ is reduced. SPD is found"

The results indicated that these methods perform comparably to state-of-the-art tensor network approaches in systems with available reference data. The flexibility and simplicity of SPD enable its application to dynamic problems, such as 3D lattices, where tensor network methods have yet to make an impact. For the studied systems, accurate results were achieved by converging observables for short-time, 2D, and 3D transverse field Ising model dynamics, or by extrapolating to zero threshold for long-time diffusion coefficients in 1D chains. Additionally, SPD proved to be a practical method for obtaining qualitatively accurate results, suggesting further"

The paper emphasizes the advantages of the Heisenberg picture for operator time evolution, particularly in high-temperature systems and operator spreading theories.\n\nThe core of the paper is the SPD algorithm, which represents an observable operator as a sum of Pauli operators with complex coefficients. The algorithm involves applying a Pauli rotation operator to the observable, which results in an exponential growth in the number of Pauli operators. To manage this, the algorithm approximates the modified observable by discarding operators with coefficients below a certain threshold, balancing computational feasibility and approximation error.\n\nThe results section presents the application of SPD to compute diffusion constants in one-dimensional (1D) spin chains at infinite temperature. The study compares SPD with the matrix-product operator (MPO) method for the tilted-field Ising model and the XX-ladder Hamiltonian. The diffusion constants are derived from the time-derivative of the mean-square displacement of dynamical correlations. The findings show that as the simulation threshold is reduced, the diffusion constants converge, demonstrating SPD's competitive accuracy.\n\nIn the conclusion, the authors summarize the successful application of SPD and its modified version, xSPD, to various quantum systems. The methods performed comparably to tensor network approaches, particularly in 3D lattices, where tensor network methods struggle. The study found that accurate results could be achieved by converging observables for short-time dynamics or extrapolating to zero thresholds for long-time diffusion coefficients. SPD proved to be a practical method for obtaining qualitatively accurate results, suggesting its potential for broader application in quantum simulations.\n\nThe paper also provides detailed implementation aspects of SPD, including the representation of Pauli operators and key operations like anticommutation and multiplication. Additionally, it describes the MPO simulations conducted using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) method and discusses critical parameters for 3D simulations, emphasizing the optimization of computational efficiency and accuracy.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of SPD in simulating quantum dynamics, offering a valuable tool for exploring complex quantum systems beyond the capabilities of traditional tensor network methods."
